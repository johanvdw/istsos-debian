    the scheduler dynamically check if scheduled job for each service
    are changed, and update the defined job.
    The scheduled job for a service are instantiated by a file named
    "serviceName.aps" that includes the jobs according the decoration methods
    of the python APScheduler library; for example:

    @sched.interval_schedule(seconds=4)
    def demo_job4():
        print 'demo job4'

    @sched.cron_schedule(second='*/30')
    def demo_decorated_task():
        print "I am printed at every minute at the 30th second!"
